## 👩‍💻 Who Am I?

Hi 👋 I’m **Nishtha**, a beginner frontend developer  
who is learning by **building, breaking, and fixing** things.

This repository is not about perfection.  
It’s about **progress**.

I’m here to learn, grow, and get better with every project.

## 💭 What I Believe

I believe that **understanding matters more than memorizing**.

Instead of just copying code,  
I try to learn **why something works**,  
because real confidence comes from clarity, not shortcuts.

Mistakes are welcome here —  
they’re proof that I’m learning.
